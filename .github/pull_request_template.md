<!--
  TITLE
    Make a self-explanatory title describing what the PR does. Keep it short, but expressive enough to signal what the reviewer can expect. You should follow the guidelines below:
      - Start the title with uppercase
      - Use imperative present tense for the main action/verb

    Example: Improve error message when creating a component
-->

## Proposed changes

This is the description of the PR. Use it to describe WHAT was changed and explain WHY and HOW it was changed. You must include screenshots if the changes you've made are related to the UI, otherwise use screenshots only if necessary. If the PR fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.

## Types of changes

What types of changes does your code introduce?
_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_.

- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation Update (none of the choices above apply)
- [ ] Other (please describe)

## PR checklist

_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR._

- [ ] Lint and unit tests pass locally with my changes
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes & features)

## Reviewer main responsibilities

You can specify areas of the code that the reviewer should pay closer attention to, as well as how they should go about testing the code changes you've made.

## Further comments [optional]

If this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered. You can also describe any actions that should be taken after the PR gets approved.
